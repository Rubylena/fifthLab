# FifthLab

Assessment for CWG FifthLab

## Introduction:

- The goal of this assessment is to test your proficiency in frontend development
  using best practices and generally accepted frontend development principles. You will be
  required to replicate a web page design, make the web page responsive and consume APIs.

Your solution would be assessed based on:

1. The simplicity/readability of your code
2. The UI of your implementation
3. Functionality of your code
4. General understanding and use of components

## Technologies to be used:

- Reactjs, Typescript, Axios, Jest

The webpage to be replicated:

- [fifthLabFrontend](https://bit.ly/fifthlabfrontend)

### Instructions:

1. Replicate the design in the link above and make it as responsive as you can on both desktop
   and mobile screen sizes
2. You are NOT to use dummy data to populate the information being displayed, but rather you
   are required to consume the Random user API which can be found here:

- [randomUser](https://randomuser.me)

3. All features and functions on the page above must work including the user search feature,
   filter by gender, download users and pagination
4. Endeavour to replicate the webpages’ look and feel by using the same colour, font size and
   font family used on the page.
5. Write unit tests for as many features as you can.
6. You are allowed to use only ONE CSS framework of your choice on this project e.g. (Tailwind,
   Bootstrap, Material UI). Do not use more than one.
7. Push the code to a private repository on your Github.
8. Deploy your code on a free-to-host platform like Netlify or Vercel and add the link to your
   project’s Github Readme file.

## How to run this application

- Clone this repository
- Open the folder in your code editor, and run the command below in your code editor.

```js
npm install
```

- Before you run the next step, you need to create an .env.local file in your root directory (i.e in the weather folder). The environment variables has been sent with the submission.

- Then run

```js
